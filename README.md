# Web App Project, BU CS411 A5
This is a fork of the github repository for the CS411 web app project done by group A5, of which I was a part of. I'm forking it to use as an example of old university projects in my portfolio, and possibly for use in future personal projects.

The web app is essentially a way to search for recipes by more general criteria like taste to get suggestions for what to make - such as when you don't know what you want to eat, but you're still hungry. You can save recipes and add different search criteria.
